### Final Submission 9-21-2017


#### My first attempt was making a replica of the incorrect PSD file. I had a background set to gray. Sorry for the confusion.



#### NOTES: Using jQuery and vanilla javascript I modified the text elements and images. I had to over ride multiple lines of CSS to come as close as I could to make a replica of the given PSD Queue Page. This was a lot of fun and I am very interested in making custom layout queue pages. The youtube video can now be played in full screen and the links work for the icons and brand name.
